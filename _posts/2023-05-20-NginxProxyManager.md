## Introduction: 
Currently the only supported way to install Nginx Proxy Manager is to run it inside of a Docker container. However, for someone like me, using Proxmox, I like to utilize LXC for my containerization. This guide will step anyone through the process of Installing Nginx Proxy Manager on a Proxmox LXC Container. 

## Preparation & Prerequisites 

1) Download the Alpine 3.16 container.

{: .prompt-warning }

2) Create a new LXC container using the downloaded Alpine 3.16 template. 

3) Log into the newly created container. Then update and upgrade the container. 

`apk update` 
`apk upgrade`

4) Next create an "npm" user on the container. It will be needed for the install script. 

`adduser npm`

5) Now run the install script. 

```
wget --no-cache -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ej52/proxmox/main/lxc/nginx-proxy-manager/setup.sh | sh
```

6) After the install script runs you will be prompted with the login URL:

![Download Alpine Linux](/klabsdev/images/NginxProxyManager/NginxProxyManager2.png)

Save this URL and port number for later as you will need it to access the web management panel. 

7) Next, using your text editor of choice edit `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`

```
nano /usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf 
```

You will need to comment out this line 
`pid /run/nginx/nginx.pid;`
to
`# pid /run/nginx/nginx.pid;`

Save and close the file. 

8)Reboot the container 

```
reboot
```

9) Enter the provided IP address in a browser and use the default login: 

```
E-Mail: admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

10) Once logged in, you will be asked to change the default admin login. Use the previously provided default login as the last login option.

Nginx Proxy Manager is now installed!

- Broken support for Alpine Linux 3.17 documented on [**Issue #118**](https://github.com/ej52/proxmox-scripts/issues/118).
- Script does not create the "npm" user by default and it is not documented outside of [**Issue #117**](https://github.com/ej52/proxmox-scripts/issues/117).
