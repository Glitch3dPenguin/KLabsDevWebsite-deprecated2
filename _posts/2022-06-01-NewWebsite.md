# Welcome!
Well, there isn't too much to say here. I am ditching my old website and starting fresh here. I am using this as a place to document my progress and to share some of my projects. This site is also a learning tool for me to understand how Ruby and Jekyll work as this is my first time using them. 

## Content to Expect
This site will act as deep storage for my brain. As I continue to work on new projects they will be documented here in a way they can be replicated.
