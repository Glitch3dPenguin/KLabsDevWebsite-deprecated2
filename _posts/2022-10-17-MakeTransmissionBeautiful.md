## Introduction
After years of building my collection of Linux ISOs I have used a solid collection of Torring software. Everything from uTorrent, Transmission, BitTorrent, qBittorrent, and more! Each software comes with its own suite of features - some better than others. After building out my home lab, I have been looking for the ultimate setup allowing me to quickly and conveniently use magnet links to add .torrents to my seed box. By far the best option that I found is Transmission's Web Daemon.
 
In my opinion the only downside is the dated and blinding web interface. I spend some time digging around in the server files and online to see if there are any 3rd party options for a better UI. Through trial and error, I feel I have found the best option for a Beautiful Transmission web interface!
 
It's called [Transmisionic](https://github.com/6c65726f79/Transmissionic) by [Samuel Leroy](https://github.com/6c65726f79)!
 
## Installation 
Getting this web overlay installed is very easy! So Letâ€™s get started!
