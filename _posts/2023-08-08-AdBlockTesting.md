## Introduction: 

This is a list I have collected of tools to test if your adblock is working and give you the ability to find more ads to build your block lists. These tools will be great for anyone testing out their PiHole, PFBlockerNG, NextDNS, Technitium, Adguard Home, or any other DNS SinkHole based ad blocking. These websites and tools are also useful for anyone looking to build their own AdBlocker.
